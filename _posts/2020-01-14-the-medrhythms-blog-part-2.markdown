## Unfamiliar Territory 
I am in my second week interning at MedRhythms, and I am still having so much fun. My projects are downright fascinating, and I feel like I am making good progress so far. I have surprised myself, to be honest -- when I was introduced to what I would be responsible for, I was somewhat panicked as I felt as though I was unprepared. I'm working in Python (not my best programming language) processing somewhat complex JSON (which I had never actually seen before starting here), but I successfully created a file format conversion script specific to the IMU data that I was tasked with "uncovering". Now, I need to figure out how to integrate this into the data processing pipeline so that I may begin analysis of the information and start to answer some big questions.

I also realize that my experience with developing in an agile environment is pretty limited, as branching and documentation best practice is something that I am learning here at MedRhythms. Those project reports that we do for Computer Science courses are for a reason, folks! 

### CS251
Speaking of the CS department data analysis, I can already tell that the experience that I am getting here is going to pay major dividends next semester when I take 251. I now feel pretty comfortable working in Python, specifically with ```pandas``` dataframes and ```numpy```. 

## The Intern Life
I am really enjoying this taste of what it would be like to be a dev/engineer at a software company. For one, being at the office every day by 8:45 AM has forced me to adopt a semi-regular sleep schedule, which is definitely a good thing. I feel as though I have enough time during the work day to get a meaningful amount done, and I usually leave around 5:00 PM. 

We have stand-up meetings that sometimes include anyone in the office, or occasionally I'll have a one-on-one with David, a software engineer here at MedRhythms who I think writes Python better than I speak English. I definitely feel like I am part of the team, and appreciate that I can be a part of these meetings.

I've also got quite a bit of autonomy, which is nice. Scary, but important. 

Since I feel as though this post is just a massive wall of text thus far, please enjoy this wonderful meme that my coworker Sara posted in the #devmemes channel of the Slack:

### Some Closing Advice
Get some experience working in an agile environment. Familiarize yourself with DevOps tools like Docker, Chef, AWS, and Git. It **will** pay off, and I'm sure it looks great on the resume. Maybe just try doing your next group CS project in a GitHub repo, and use the Colby wiki on Confluence for writing some kickass documentation.
