## What's MedRhythms? 
From [their site](https://www.medrhythms.com/):
>MedRhythms is a digital therapeutics company that uses sensors, music, and AI to build evidence-based, neurologic interventions to measure and improve walking. Our algorithms deliver personalized gait therapeutics to patients, providing them with accurate, real-world data. This data can be applied to improve our therapeutic, track progress over time, and predict adverse events. Our vision is to build a suite of therapeutics and diagnostics for movement, language, and cognitive deficits.

Their digital therapeutics platform for walking based on rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) is awesome. Read more about RAS [here](https://www.medrhythms.com/scientific-approach).

## What does this have to do with you, Tyler?
I have the honor and privilege of working as an intern for MedRhythms as an intern during Colby's 2020 "JanPlan" semester. I will be maintaining this blog per the instruction of Prof. Bruce Maxwell, and it will serve as my project for academic credit. This is meant to be a tool for other Colby students to learn about the internship process in great detail.

## What will you be doing at MedRhythms?
In the interest of confidentiality, I can tell you that I am working with an insane amount of data that comes from IMUs (inertial measurement units) writing some interesting file format conversion code so that the data can be more readily accessed. Once this is complete, I will be statistically analyzing the data and hopefully revealing some very important takeaways that contribute to the development of MedRhythms' product pipeline.

## How did you land such an amazing gig?
I found the position on Handshake, and I believe that most JanPlan opportunities are posted here as the student platform is specific to Colby. I applied and had two or three phone interviews about my background and what I hoped to get out of the internship. Later, I got an email that I had indeed gotten the position and a formal offer letter. So, no technical interview this time around, but I was asked many questions about my software and data analytics experience. 

## First impressions?
My first day was yesterday, and I am thoroughly enjoying working here! Firstly, the office happens to be in my favorite coffee shop of all time, so I get to work ~45 minutes early and grab myself a vanilla latte. I have a feeling that this is going to become habitual and I am about to spend way too much money at Bard.

I also have my very own desk!

My coworkers are so kind and thoughtful. They brought in donuts (Holy Donut, true confection perfection) and Owen, our President, took the entire team out to lunch at Slab to celebrate my first day. I greatly enjoyed meeting everyone and am very much excited to be a part of this organization.

Also, there are DOGS in the office!!! They are wonderful.
