Do you know when you jolt awake in the middle of the night, and realize/remember something that your subconscious has been working on? That happened to me the other night. At probably 3:45 AM, I realized that I have a blog!

## What's the plan?

I'm going to do my best to post on here weekly at a minimum. I doubt many folks are going to take the time to read my posts, but this is more for me than anyone else. I'm going through *a lot* right now, and I've read that the practice of keeping a journal or blog is pretty good for your mental health. Unfortunately, I don't have anything interesting to post today since I've only just decided to give this another try, so please enjoy these photos from r/eyebleach and take a break from the news headlines:

## That's all for now, folks.

I hope everyone is having a good week has a fun-filled Halloween. I know mine will be -- differential equations and quantum phyiscs problem sets! REALLY spooky stuff.
