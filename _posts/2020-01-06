## What's MedRhythms? 
From [their site](https://www.medrhythms.com/):
>MedRhythms is a digital therapeutics company that uses sensors, music, and AI to build evidence-based, neurologic interventions to measure and improve walking. Our algorithms deliver personalized gait therapeutics to patients, providing them with accurate, real-world data. This data can be applied to improve our therapeutic, track progress over time, and predict adverse events. Our vision is to build a suite of therapeutics and diagnostics for movement, language, and cognitive deficits.

Their digital therapeutics platform for walking based on rythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) is awesome. Read more about RAS [here](https://www.medrhythms.com/scientific-approach).

## What does this have to do with you, Tyler?

I hope everyone is having a good week has a fun-filled Halloween. I know mine will be -- differential equations and quantum phyiscs problem sets! REALLY spooky stuff.
